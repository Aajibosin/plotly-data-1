# Plotly project
### Purpose
The Plotly Visualization Project is to complete a dashboard using panel for demographic information to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.


### Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individualâ€™s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.
